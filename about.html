        <span style="font-size: 60px">Thanks for viewing my site.<br></span><br>
        The motivation for making it was simple... there are lots of good ukiyo-e resources out there, but not of them match prints to their depicted locations, despite a lot of the prints being based in real loactions.
        All of the images are sourced from wiki commons, and are in the public domain, while the locations have either come from wikipedia<sup>[1][2]</sup>, various other sites around the internet who claim to have locations of prints, or my best guesses based off of general locational information.
        There are most likely some inacuracies, however I strive to make all print locations as accurate as I can.<br><br>

            <div style="width: 90%; float: left; text-align: left">
                The entire site is open sourced on GitHub, and anyone can submit a pull request to it for review. I will require some kind of evidence of correct locations as well as set completeness.
